    "Description": "The human liver cytosol stability model is used for predicting the stability of a drug in the cytosol of human liver cells, which is beneficial for identifying potential drug candidates early during the drug discovery process. If a drug compound is quickly absorbed, it may not reach the intended target in the body or become toxic. On the other hand, if a drug compound is too stable, it could accumulate and cause detrimental effects.",

    "Output Shape": "Single",
    "Interpretation": "The human liver cytosol stability model measures the probability of a given compound being stable or unstable. A predicted class of 1 indicates that the compound has poor stability (>0.5: Unstable), and a predicted class of 0 indicates the probability of a compound being stable (<0.5: Stable)",
