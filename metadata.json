    "Description": "The human liver cytosol stability model is used for predicting the stability of a drug in the cytosol of human liver cells, which is beneficial for identifying potential drug candidates early during the drug discovery process. If a drug compound is quickly absorbed, it may not reach the intended target in the body or become toxic. On the other hand, if a drug compound is too stable, it could accumulate and cause detrimental effects.",
